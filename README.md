**Project Descriptions**

**1. Agglomerative Clustering – Student Grouping**

This project uses Agglomerative Clustering to group students into two clusters based on their marks.
It helps to identify high-performing and low-performing groups using unsupervised learning.

**2. Food Delivery Time Prediction**

In this project, various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Linear Regression, and Stacking are used to predict food delivery time.
The model considers multiple real-world features like distance, traffic, weather, and vehicle condition to make accurate predictions.

**3. Support Vector Machine – Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction**

This project uses Support Vector Machine to predict the likelihood of thyroid cancer recurrence. 
The model is trained on detailed clinical data including age, gender, smoking habits, radiotherapy history, test results, tumor stage, and more.
It helps in assessing patient risk and improving treatment decisions.
